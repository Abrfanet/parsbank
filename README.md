# ParsBank
==============

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/parsbank.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/parsbank)  
![Build Status](https://github.com/abrfanet/ParsBank/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

**ParsBank Gateway** is a Ruby gem designed to integrate with WSDL and JSON APIs of all payments methods such as cryptocurrency platforms (e.g., Bitcoin, USDT), and traditional payment platforms like Stripe and PayPal or private banks such as Troy bank or persians banks. This gem leverages **SOAP** and **Faraday** libraries, optimized for multiple retries during connection failures or timeouts. Additionally, it includes a proxy wrapper for connecting to core banks via MITM (man-in-the-middle) servers.

## Usage

### Step 1: Configure ParsBank
Create a configuration file in `config/initializers` (e.g., `config/initializers/pars_bank.rb`):

```ruby
ParsBank.configuration do |config|
  config.callback_url = 'https://example.com/CallBack' # Your callback URL
  config.debug = false                                 # Enable logging (Rails logs and STDOUT)
  config.sandbox = false                               # Simulate requests and auto-approve callbacks
  config.webhook = 'https://yoursite.com/income-webhook?title=TITLE&message=MESSAGE' # Transaction notification webhook
  config.webhook_method = 'GET'                        # Webhook HTTP method (GET or POST)
  config.mitm_server = 'https://your-mitm-server.com'  # MITM server location
  config.secrets_path = Rails.root.join('config/bank_secrets.yaml') # Path to bank credentials (e.g., merchant ID, tokens)

  # Web Panel Configuration
  config.webpanel_path = '/parsbank'                   # Web panel path
  config.username = ENV['PARSBANK_USERNAME']           # Web panel username
  config.password = ENV['PARSBANK_PASSWORD']           # Web panel password
  config.allowed_ips = ['192.168.10.10']               # Restrict access by IP (use '*' to allow all)
  config.allow_when = ->(username, password) {         # Authentication using a Rails model
    user = User.find_by(username: username)
    user&.authenticate(password) && user.admin?
  }
  config.captcha = false                               # Enable CAPTCHA for security
  config.model = Transaction                          # Define transaction model (must include fields like amount, status, etc.)
end
```

### Step 2: Use ParsBank in Your Controller

Use the `get_redirect_from` method to generate a redirect form for users:

```ruby
class CartController < ApplicationController
  # @INPUT fiat_amount: can be dollars or rials
  # @INPUT crypto_amount: can be crypto assets amount like 0.0005
  # @INPUT real_amount: When use crypto or Rials can use dollar instead amount of crypto (E.G 100 dollar equal 0.005 bitcoin)
  # @INPUT description(required): Explain transaction details
  # @INPUT bank: Select specific bank or payment method like 'bsc-binance', 'nobitex', 'zarinpal', 'perfect-money'
  # @INPUT tags: Used for call which payments method such as ['crypto','rls','dollar','persian-banks','russian-banks']
  # @OUTPUT get_redirect_from: an javascript code for redirect user to gateways
  def redirect_to_parsbank
    form = ParsBank.get_redirect_from(fiat_amount: '10', description: 'Charge Account')
    render html: form
  end

  # @DESC: Shortcode for get all of enabled paymetns methods
  # @INPUT tags(Optional): ['crypto','rls','dollar','persian-banks','russian-banks']
  # @OUTPUT gateways_list_shortcode: List of all banks with name and logo with ul wrapper as html
  def choose_payment
    @payments_list_available_shortcode = ParsBank.gateways_list_shortcode
  end

  # @DESC: Parse all returned params from banks for verify transaction
  # @OUTPUT verify_transaction: Return transaction status as json like {status: 200, message: 'Payment Successfull'}
  def callback
    @parsbank_verifier= ParsBank.verify_transaction
    if @parsbank_verifier[:status] == 200
      flash[:success]= @parsbank_verifier[:message]
      redirect_to Something_path
    else
      flash[:error]= @parsbank_verifier[:message]
      redirect_to Something_path
    end
  end


end
```
